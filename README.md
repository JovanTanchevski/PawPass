## 💡 Why PawPass?

- Pet owners often lose or damage their physical vaccination booklets.  
- Vets still rely on paper or disconnected systems that don’t sync with owners’ data.  
- There’s no unified, region-friendly system for tracking pets’ medical history digitally.  

PawPass solves this by offering:
- **A central place for pet health data**
- **Automated reminders** for time-sensitive care
- **Simple sharing** between owners and vets
